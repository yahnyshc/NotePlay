The programm accepts following input:
Options: 1,2,3,4.
Colours: 1,2,3,4,5.
Notes: A,B,C,D,E,F,G.

Allows the user to input screen colour repeatedly and responds to that, changing the
colour, features at least 3 colour options. Exits the program properly.
Can select cls and stave (5 horizontal lines) options. Can
choose colour of screen or position of stave. Can deal with a bad option by exiting or
repeating question. Can repeat option selection.
Can accept multiple char inputs for a note and draw a
square in the appropriate place on screen. Can play the note.

Code design: A

Uses spill when calling procedure(s). Uses procedure(s) effectively.
Makes good use of a procedure (for the stave) and labels. Very little repeated code.
Implements loops using branch and labels well.

Comments/clarity: A

Clear structure (and helpful comments) about variable use. Well commented
throughout. Spaced and organised for clarity.
Reasonable organisation, can follow program reasonably well.
Variable use is sensible (ie $a for passing in and $v to return from parameter).
